"""Binding READMEs must not use repository-relative links.

Each binding README is, or is one workflow line away from being, the long
description of a published package: PyPI renders the Python one, NuGet the C#
one, pkg.go.dev the Go one, r-universe the R one. A link like
`../../docs/COOKBOOK.md` resolves on GitHub and nowhere else -- on a registry
page it is simply broken, and nothing in the build says so, because the file it
points at does exist in the repository.

So the rule is: anything that ships as package metadata links absolutely. The
repository's own README is exempt and deliberately keeps relative links -- it is
read on GitHub far more than anywhere else, and that is the convention the main
wickra repository uses too.

The READMEs are found by walking `bindings/`, not by a fixed-depth glob. The
sibling repositories keep every binding README at `bindings/<lang>/README.md`,
but this one ships the C# text from `bindings/csharp/WickraXray/README.md`,
beside the csproj that names it in `<PackageReadmeFile>`. A `bindings/*/README.md`
glob skips exactly that file -- the NuGet case this script's own docstring
promises to cover -- and reports success while doing it.
