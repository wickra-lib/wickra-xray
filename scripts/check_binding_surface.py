"""Assert that every binding exposes the surface the C ABI declares.

Ten language reaches sit on one C ABI. Each has its own test suite and each is
written separately, so a reach that falls behind fails nowhere: the golden corpus
compares *values*, and a binding that never grew a method simply has no test to
run. A language that silently lost `version` would still pass every golden test
it has, because no golden fixture asks for a version.

The header is the source of truth. Every export in it is a promise the bindings
make, so this reads `wickra_xray_<name>` out of
`bindings/c/include/wickra_xray.h` and checks each language's public surface
for that name, spelled the way that language spells it.

One export is deliberately not part of the language surface:

  free    a memory-management detail of the ABI. Go spells releasing a handle
          `Close`, C# `Dispose`, Java `close`, R registers a finalizer, and
          Python, Node and WASM let the runtime do it. Demanding one spelling
          across all of them would report idiom as drift, so the release path is
          each language's own contract and is not checked here.

Extras run the other way: a binding method with no export behind it is reported
as a note, not a failure. That is how a language gets *ahead* of the ABI, which
is worth seeing but is not drift in the dangerous direction.

Declarations are matched, not occurrences. A doc comment naming the function, or
an internal call site, must not let a renamed export pass unnoticed.
